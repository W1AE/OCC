True Freedom-Lovers Wear Face Masks,Bloomberg News,5/15/2020,Want to help open up the economy? Want to stick it to the World Health Organization? Wear a mask!,"Face masks are at risk of becoming a victim of America’s culture wars, with a few conservative activists and commentators linking their use to cowardice, civil-rights violations and that worst of scourges, “the safetyism ideology that has jumped from the university to the public sphere.” I do not wish to exaggerate the strength of this anti-mask movement",there does seem to be broader incidence of mask-apathy and mask-embarrassment that such rhetoric risks hardening into outright opposition.,"This makes me sad, not just because there’s a reasonable chance that widespread mask-wearing could save lots of lives by slowing the spread of Covid-19, but because courageous, anti-authoritarian freedom-lovers ought by all rights to be big mask fans.","The rise of face masks as a response to the pandemic has been a largely grass-roots phenomenon, conceived in opposition to the recommendations of health authorities such as the U.S. surgeon general and the World Health Organization ","the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention came around to endorsing masks in April, and some states have recently begun requiring them in stores and other public indoor spaces."," I get that such decrees rub some people the wrong way, and that mask-nannying by the news media does, too. But mask requirements are an awful lot less freedom-restricting than orders to stay at home or keep all “nonessential” businesses shuttered, and letting one’s views be defined by opposition to anything the mainstream media says is not free thought. ",Wearing masks appears to be the simplest way to get much of normal life (and normal economic activity) back while we’re still figuring out how exactly to control and maybe defeat Covid-19 by less-primitive means. ,,,,,,,,
"Wear a Mask, Because Stone Cold Said So",Bloomberg News,5/15/2020,"And yet when he posted a picture of himself on Instagram wearing a mask — with the University of Alabama football team’s logo on it, no less — somebody complained he was not only soft but also conforming to communism","Some people resist wearing masks simply because they think it looks weird. It certainly feels weird, bordering on miserable. (Stone Cold’s mask looks a little hot for Los Angeles, much less Alabama.) ","The evidence keeps growing that widespread mask-wearing will actually make it more likely we can end pandemic lockdowns safely, letting us get out and about without spreading germs.",That argument should be good enough for many mask-skeptics. But it probably won’t satisfy those armed protesters storming legislatures demanding to be allowed back into Chuck E. Cheese ASAP.,His campaign and presidency have one unifying theme: a promise to destroy the country rather than hand it to the mask-wearing types. He seems to be making a lot of headway.,"Noah Feldman writes the court invented a technicality to express the sort of right-wing panic that sees all of this, from lockdown orders to masks, as a plot to install a socialist government.

Italy Learns a Hard Lesson on Face Masks,Bloomberg News,5/14/2020,"The problem with fixing a very low price on face masks is that it will cause shortages, unless you boost supply.",It takes economics students a couple of classes to understand why price caps are generally a bad idea. The Italian government has nonetheless chosen to set one for face masks — and it’s learning the lesson the hard way.,"That is what’s happening in Italy after the government said surgical masks should cost 50 euro cents (54 cents), excluding VAT.","Domestically, a number of Italian businesses that had reconverted their production lines to make masks now say the price is just too low to meet their costs. The government says it will compensate those pharmacists who’ve paid more for their masks than the sale price, but that won’t solve the scarcity problem.","Scientists believe that face masks can help contain the spread of Covid-19, especially in places where social distancing is hard, such as on public transport. ","Letting citizens purchase face masks at a reasonable price isn’t just about being fair to the poorest citizens; it will also make the mask policy more effective, since it will boost compliance and help reduce the risk of contagion. ","The government can then purchase these goods at their market value, and distribute them at whatever price it wishes. If it has to pay more than the price at which the masks are sold to the public, then so be it. ",Italy isn’t the only country to fix the price for face masks. South Korea and Taiwan have done it too.,,,,,,,,

America’s Coronavirus Report Card: Grim But Incomplete,Bloomberg News,5/7/2020,Another big project would be to equip every American with a quality mask and promote mask-wearing as “the new normal.” ,"Early advice from public-health authorities was that mask-wearing was not worthwhile, though this turned out to be incorrect. Meanwhile federal restrictions made it difficult to import masks, even though the country’s mask stockpile had been greatly depleted in 2009 and not replenished.

Straight Talk About Masks and Coronavirus Prevention,Bloomberg News,3/25/2020,A procedural mask loosely covers the mouth and nose of the wearer and has straps that go over the ears.,"The surgical mask is meant for operating rooms and other sterile environments, procedural masks for areas that need to be clean but not necessarily sterile. "," so please let me know if I got anything wrong, or if you can explain to me how melt-blowing works) because health officials in Western countries have been giving some pretty confounding advice about the use of masks in fighting the coronavirus pandemic.For example:
Seriously people- STOP BUYING MASKS! 
","having tried wearing N95 masks during past visits to polluted Chinese cities and having found the experience so unpleasant that I decided to suck in deadly particulates instead, I am dubious that many people not in situations of intense peril would really wear the things consistently enough to protect themselves."," If Western countries want to restart their economies safely if and when the stay-at-home orders succeed in halting the spread of the virus, the wearing of such masks should probably be strongly encouraged.","The concern that panic buying of surgical masks will keep them out of the hands of those who need them most is, on the other hand, not nonsense. ","Instead of telling people not to wear masks, though, Singaporean authorities announced at the end of January that they would be giving four procedural masks to each of the nation","The head of the Centre for Infection at the University of Hong Kong suggested last week, for example, that non-mask-wearers be banned from public transit there for the time being.

","The number of face masks in that strategic reserve was depleted in the swine-flu outbreak of 2009 and as of early March it held only about 12 million N95 respirators and 30 million surgical masks, significantly fewer than the 3.5 billion masks experts estimate the U.S. would need in a severe pandemic, according to the Washington Post.","Companies such as 3M Co. and Honeywell International Inc. already make masks and personal-protective gear, but they will need help to meet the huge demand.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sold-Out Coronavirus N95 Face Masks Offer a Lesson in Price Gouging,Bloomberg News,1/31/2020,"Now that the government has confirmed the first human-to-human transmission of the new coronavirus in the U.S., a lot of people will be rushing out to purchase masks. That would be, specifically, the N95 air filtration mask, the one recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for blocking most airborne viruses.","And no matter how many experts query whether the N95 mask would even stop transmission of the virus, supply still can’t keep up with demand.",Let’s begin with a thought experiment: Suppose that an entrepreneur — we’ll call him Carter — turns out to have stockpiled several thousand N95 masks a few years ago.,"He even sets up a website where people can bid. Every ten minutes, until the supply is gone, the highest bidder wins 20 masks. ","Carter caves. Humiliated, and worried about his business prospects, he donates his entire store of N95 masks to public health authorities, who in turn will give them out if deemed necessary (that is, if deemed necessary in their view) according to some rationing formula that will be shared with the public only if what the authorities deem to be an emergency should arise. (In China, masks are already being rationed by the government.)","Here’s the simplest reason: Smarter, who happens to possess an even bigger cache of N95 masks than Carter did, will observe how he was treated and decide to keep hers under lock and key. ","As a result of the insistence that Carter not sell his property at the price the market is willing to pay, the supply of N95 masks to the public is smaller than if nobody had intervened.",,,,,,,,,
